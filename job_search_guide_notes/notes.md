## Restful API
  - REST stands for Representational State Transfer
### Fielding Constraints
  - Architectural constraints that a system must satisfy to be considered RESTful
#### Client-server
  - Network must be made up of clients and servers.
  - opposite of non-Restful architecture where there is not one to one communication rather a broadcasting and eavesdropping method
  - RESTful requires one to one communication.
#### Stateless
  - Both connections do not keep track of each other's states.
#### Uniform Interface
  - common language between servers and clients that allows each part to be swapped out or modified without breaking the entire system.
  - 4 sub constraints( identification of resources, manipulation of resources through representations, self-descriptive messages, and hypermedia)
##### Identification of resources
  - "stable" identifier, does not change across interactions.
##### Manipulation of resources through representations
  -
